### 4 MVP Specification

##### User Interface (UI)
This is the web application that users will interact with to input their preferences and receive hotel recommendations.
##### Backend Server
This is the server-side component that processes user requests, interacts with APIs, and generates recommendations.
##### API Gateway
This component acts as a single entry point for all API requests from the UI and routes them to the appropriate backend services.
##### Hotel Booking APIs
These APIs can be integrated in future iterations to allow users to seamlessly book hotels from recommended options.
##### Travel Data APIs
These APIs can be integrated in future iterations to enrich user profiles and personalize recommendations based on travel trends. (Not included in MVP)
##### Database
This stores user preferences and potentially hotel information retrieved from APIs.

## 5 APIs and Methods

### 3rd Party APIs
##### Booking.com API
Booking.com provides access to hotel booking data, including information about available accommodations, prices, and reviews.
Usage: It will be utilized to fetch additional hotel data and enhance the recommendation process.

##### Google Places API
Google places API Offers information about places, including hotels, restaurants, and tourist attractions, based on geographical location.
Usage: It will be used to retrieve details about hotels, such as location, amenities, and user ratings, to augment the recommendation system.

These APIs and methods facilitate communication between the web client, backend server, and external services, enabling the hotel recommendation app to provide personalized suggestions to users based on their preferences and requirements.

**NOTE:** We will not utilize these third-party APIs in the MVP to focus on core functionalities.

### 8. Challenge Statement
Challenge
Choosing the perfect hotel can be overwhelming, with countless options and conflicting reviews.  Trip Tailor aims to solve this by providing personalized hotel recommendations based on user preferences, travel style, location, budget, and amenities.
 


***What We Won't Solve**
Trip Tailor won't handle actual hotel bookings. It will integrate with existing booking APIs to seamlessly connect users with their chosen hotels.  We also won't provide real-time hotel availability (though this could be explored in future iterations).

**Target Users**
Trip Tailor caters to travelers seeking a convenient and personalized hotel recommendation experience. This includes frequent travelers, budget-conscious tourists, and those looking for unique or boutique hotel experiences. Trip Tailor will benefit travel enthusiasts exploring new destinations, and business travelers looking for convenient accommodations.

**Locale Dependence**
Trip Tailor is not location-specific and can be used for travel planning worldwide. However, the hotel recommendations will be based on the user's chosen destination.
